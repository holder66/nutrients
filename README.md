# nutrients
This Filemaker solution uses data from the USDA nutrients database (SR27 version) to provide information about the content of certain amino acids (arginine, methionine, leucine, glycine, and cysteine) in individual foods, as well as vitamin K and choline content. It also shows percentage content of protein, carbohydrates, fats, water, and fibre. In addition, the PRAL (Potential Renal Acid Load) values in mEq are calculated.
## Requirements
As a Filemaker database, you will need a copy of Filemaker Pro on your desktop (available 
through filemaker.com), or the free app Filemaker Go on your iOS device (available in the 
app store).
